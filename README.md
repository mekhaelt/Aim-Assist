## Overview

The Aim Assist project develops a prosthetic arm that replicates the biomechanics of a human arm to shoot a basketball. Designed for individuals with upper limb disabilities or amputations, this prosthetic enhances physical activity and psychological well-being by enabling participation in sports.

## Features

-   **Biomechanical Accuracy**: Mimics natural arm movements including elbow and shoulder flexion and wrist flick.
-   **Customizable Settings**: Engineered to adjust for optimal release speed, angle, and spin.
-   **Arduino Integration**: Uses Arduino Uno to synchronize motor movements with EMG signal inputs for real-time responsiveness.

## Technology Stack

-   **Mechanical Design**: Gears and linkages to simulate arm motion.
-   **Electronics**: Arduino Uno and Servo Motors (HS-805BB).
-   **Fabrication**: 3D printed with Polylactic Acid (PLA) for durability and lightness.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github/aim-assist.git
```

-   Assemble the hardware according to the diagrams provided in the `docs/assembly_instructions.pdf`.
-   Install Arduino dependencies.

## Usage

-   Attach the prosthetic arm following the personal fitting instructions.
-   Calibrate the EMG sensors as per the user guide.
-   Use the provided scripts to test and calibrate the shooting mechanism.
